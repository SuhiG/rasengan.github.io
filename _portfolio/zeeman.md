<div style="text-align: justify"> Mathematically, combinatorial optimisation problems can be represented using an Ising model combined with a Zeeman term. However, soft-spin-based computing architectures like Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) and Simulated Bifurcation Machines (SBMs) have difficulty realising Zeeman terms because of the size mismatch between the linear and quadratic terms in the Ising Hamiltonians. The objective of this project is to investigate if the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) method can be used to simulate artificial Zeeman terms effectively on a CIM. </div>
