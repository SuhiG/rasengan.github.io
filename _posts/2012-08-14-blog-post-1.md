This post introduces the basic concept of the Coherent Ising Machine (CIM)

Ising model and Ising solvers
======

<div style="text-align: justify"> Ising models can work as solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), such as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, which are commonly encountered in real-life problems like scheduling problems, drug discovery, machine learning etc. Therefore, it is possible to map many COPs to the problem of searching for the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. However, finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP-hard) problem, requiring computation time on an exponential scale relative to the size of the problem. There is a strong demand for Ising solvers for COPs due to the importance of these real-world problems. The development of dedicated hardware for searching the Ising Hamiltonian ground state has been active in recent years. Particularly, Ising machines inspired by quantum physics have attracted wide attention due to their potential to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties for large COPs. As of yet, however, there is still a problem with realizing Zeeman terms in quantum-inspired Ising machines. Ising Hamiltonian, including Zeeman term, is expressed as follows.   </div> 

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{IsingHamiltonian}
                H = -  \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{r=1}^N\sum_{r'=1}^NJ_{rr'}\sigma_r \sigma_{r'} - {\zeta}\sum_{r=1}^N h_r\sigma_r .
        \end{equation}
$$
 </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
where $\sigma_r$ represents the Ising spin variable taking either $+1$ or $-1$, and $J_{rr'}$ implies the coupling weight between spins $r$ and $r'$. Here the diagonal entries are set to 0.
The second term in eq. (\ref{IsingHamiltonian}) indicates the external field present for each spin which is generally called the Zeeman term. $\zeta$ is the Zeeman strength adjustment parameter. Using the Ising Hamiltonian definition (eq. (\ref{IsingHamiltonian})), the local field of each Ising spin can be described as follows.   </div> 

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{IsingLocal}
                f_r = \sum_{r'=1 (\neq r)}^N J_{rr'}\sigma_{r'} + {\zeta} h_r .
        \end{equation}
$$
 </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Eq. (\ref{IsingLocal}) contains two terms, the first of which indicates the interaction term and the second of which indicates the Zeeman term.  </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In the conventional case the Ising Hamiltonian, which includes the Zeeman term (eq. (\ref{IsingHamiltonian})), as well as the local field (eq. (\ref{IsingLocal})) for each Ising spin, is defined based on the assumption that each spin variable takes either $+1$ or $-1$. In CIMs, as well as SBMs, the spin amplitudes are continuous values that are different from $\pm 1$, so the interaction term and Zeeman term's contribution to the local field depend on the amplitude of the spin variable. As a consequence of the size mismatch between the interaction term and the Zeeman term, Ising machines may produce biased solutions which are inconsistent with the Hamiltonian defined by eq. (\ref{IsingHamiltonian}).  </div>  <br>

**Measurement Feedback CIM**

<div style="text-align: justify"> A CIM consists of a set of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), where oscillations above the threshold limit constitute an optimum solution to a Hamiltonian.
Using an optical cavity in conjunction with a phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA), a coherent state can be achieved in the CIM. This allows the spin-up state to be defined as $0$-phase and the spin-down state as $\pi$-phase, and the overall state to be defined as an Ising spin model. The $J$ matrix or the mutual coupling matrix is created using a mutual injection field. The measurement feedback CIM (MFB-CIM) master equation can be expressed as follows.   </div> 

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{master}
            \frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t} = \sum_{r} \left( \frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t} \right)_{DOPO, r} + \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t}\right)_{S.R} + \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t}\right)_{F.B} ,
        \end{equation}
$$
 </div>

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{dopo}
            \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t}\right)_{DOPO, r} = \left( \left[ \hat{a}_r , \hat{\rho}\hat{a}_r^{\dagger}\right] + {\rm H.c.} \right) + \frac{p}{2} \left[\hat{a}_r^{\dagger 2} - \hat{a}_r^{2},\hat{\rho}\right] + \frac{g^2}{2}\left(\left[\hat{a}_r^2 , \hat{\rho}\hat{a}_r^{\dagger 2}\right] + {\rm H.c.}\right) ,
        \end{equation}
$$
 </div>

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{SR}
            \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t}\right)_{S.R} = \frac{j}{2}\sum_r \left( \left[ \hat{a}_r , \hat{\rho}\hat{a}_r^{\dagger}\right] + {\rm H.c.} \right)\\ + \sqrt{j}\sum_r \left(\hat{a}_r\hat{\rho} + \hat{\rho}\hat{a}_r^{\dagger} - \langle \hat{a}_r + \hat{a}_r^{\dagger} \rangle \hat{\rho} \right) W_{R,r} ,
        \end{equation}
$$
 </div>

<div style="text-align: center"> 
$$
        \begin{equation}
        \label{FB}
            \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}}{\partial t}\right)_{F.B} = \frac{j}{2}\sum_r \left( \left[ \hat{a}_r , \hat{\rho}\hat{a}_r^{\dagger}\right] + {\rm H.c.} \right)\\ + j\sum_{rr'}J_{rr'}\left(\frac{\langle \hat{a}_{r'} + \hat{a}_{r'}^{\dagger} \rangle}{2} + \frac{W_{R,r'}}{2\sqrt{j}}\right)\left[\hat{a}_r^{\dagger} - \hat{a}_r ,\hat{\rho}\right] .
        \end{equation}
$$

<div style="text-align: justify"> As part of MFB-CIM, the output coupler extracts small portions of signal pulses, and the amplitudes of these pulses are measured using optical homodyne detection. Using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the feedback signal can be calculated using this measurement. Then through the use of an optical injection coupler, the calculated feedback pulses are injected into the main fiber ring cavity. In this case, $r \in \left\{1, 2, ... , N\right\}$ represents the index of signal pulses.    </div> 

<div style="text-align: justify"> In the equation above, $\hat{a}_r$ indicates the annihilation operator of the $r$-th signal. Considering a normalized setting, eq. (\ref{dopo}) shows the master equation of a $r$-th DOPO in which the round-trip time is regarded as being smaller than the linear dissipation time.
Then the linear loss caused by measurements, as well as a state reduction due to measurements, are described in eq. (\ref{SR}).
It is necessary to use this additional term due to the homodyne measurement and the placement of the outlet coupler which allows a small portion of the DOPO pulse to be extracted for measurement. Here $j$, $p$, and $W_r$ represent the dissipation rate, oscillation threshold and Gaussian white noise as vacuum fluctuations where $\langle W_{R,r} (t)\rangle = 0$ and $\langle W_{R,r} (t)W_{R,r'} (t')\rangle = \delta_{rr'}\delta(t-t')$. 
Regarding feedback, eq. (\ref{FB}) refers to the injection of feedback through the injection coupler. </div> <br>
