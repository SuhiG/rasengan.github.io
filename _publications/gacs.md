collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gacs
excerpt: 'Coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators that can solve large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems by finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. As a practical application of CIM, Aonishi et al., proposed a quantum-classical hybrid system to solve optimisation problems of L0-regularisation-based compressed sensing. In the hybrid system, the CIM was an open-loop system without an amplitude control feedback loop. In this case, the hybrid system is enhanced by using a closed-loop CIM to achieve chaotic behaviour around the target amplitude, which would enable escaping from local minima in the energy landscape. Both artificial and magnetic resonance image data were used for the testing of our proposed closed-loop system. Compared with the open-loop system, the results of this study demonstrate an improved degree of accuracy and a wider range of effectiveness.'
